# 🏥 High-Throughput Health Data System with Cassandra & ML Preprocessing

This project implements a scalable health data management system using **Apache Cassandra** for efficient data storage and retrieval. It integrates machine learning preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare data for predictive analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Designed a **high-throughput data pipeline** for health records using Cassandra’s distributed NoSQL database capabilities.
- Implemented **data cleaning and preprocessing** using ML techniques to handle missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.
- Enabled **predictive analytics** on the cleaned data for early disease detection and health trend analysis.
- Focused on **scalability**, **fault tolerance**, and **fast data access** for large health datasets.
